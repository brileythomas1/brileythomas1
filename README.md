  ## Hello there! 👋

I'm Briley, a junior at Yale University studying Computer Science and History. My core interests lie at the intersection of these two fields, where I hope to utilize my unconventional skillset in order to advance the study of history and the humanities using computer science techniques. Feel free to browse through some of my past projects!

Some of my work includes:

 - Acting as a teaching assistant for Yale's Data Structures course 🧑‍🏫
 - Building neural networks for natural language processing to reconstruct a map of the internal boundaries of Tokugawa Japan 🗾
 - Working in a team of Yalies to develop an online platform for students to connect with each other on campus 👥

Just a few of my (ambitious) project ideas are:

 - A website to simplify and consolidate the process of international travel ✈️
 - A hardcore, all-in-one language learning platform that encourages long-term user commitment 🈳
 - An accessible resource for engaging, quality history education 📗
 - "Google Maps" for different time periods and countries 🗺️
 - A Bible study website with expert interpretations and a variety of translations
